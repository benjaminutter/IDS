PROBLEM 1:
Table: Summary of chicken weights to the food types

Food Type     Min Weight     Mean Weight     Max Weight
=======================================================
Casein        216            323.58          404
Horsebean     108            160.2           227
Linseed       141            218.75          309
Meatmeal      153            276.91          380
Soybean       158            246.43          329
Sunflower     226            328.92          423

After reviewing the table, I conclude that the sunflower feed would be the most beneficial to begin my poultry business. The average weight of the chicken is the highest which will allow me to have the most amount of meat out of one chicken.



PROBLEM 2:
Insurance Provider   |   Average Score
GEICO                |   7.4
Progressive          |   7.66
USAA                 |   6.1

After looking at the average scores, I would have to go with Progressive becasue they consistently have the highest scores. Even though GEICO has two high scores, one customer was not satisfied with them which can help outline some inconsistencies.
